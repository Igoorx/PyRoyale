I really liked the idea of this game and, as I already imagined that it would fall for the DMCA, I did a server for it, but this server is not currently the best thing in the world, its purpose is to only allow playing with friends, the use of it to other reasons can be dangerous since it has no anti-hack protection.

You can discuss about the game and this emulator in [our discord](https://discord.gg/RqszZY6).

## Binaries
If you are on Windows and don't want to install python to run this server, you can use the latest binary released in the [releases page](https://github.com/Igoorx/PyRoyale/releases).

## Dependencies
This project uses Python <b>2.7</b> and the following dependencies:
- Twisted
- AutoBahn
- Emoji
- ConfigParser

<b>If you are on Windows, the module <u>pypiwin32</u> may also be required.</b> 

## Tutorial
Oops.. There isn't yet a tutorial, but you can get help in [our discord](https://discord.gg/RqszZY6).
